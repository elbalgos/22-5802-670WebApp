        <h3>
            In the 21st season of his NBA career, Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James <br>
            continues to reach milestones that no one else has.
            <br>
            <br>
            The latest was <u>reaching 40,000 career points when James made a layup</u> in the <br>
            second quarter of Saturday night's loss to the Denver Nuggets.
            <br>
            <br>
            LeBron, of course, broke the NBA scoring record last February and now with each <br>
            game, he is continuing to build on his record with it potentially reaching a number so <br>
            high that will never be broken.
            <br>
            <br>
            As he reached another ridiculous accomplishment, the basketball world took to <br>
            social media to congratulate James with Magic Johnson, Lamar Odom, Metta World Peace, <br>
            Kendrick Perkins, Isaiah Thomas, and Gilbert Arenas among those to send out posts.
